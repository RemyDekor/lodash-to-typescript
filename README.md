This repository uses the `vscode-twoslash-queries` extension to use the `// Ë†?` syntax to display the types without having to hover the variables manually.

Check out the `presentation.ts` file for lodash/remeda comparison in the IDE.

If you want to experiment stuff yourself, it's currently the `main.ts` file which executes when you run:
```
npm run dev
```
